# MSTU 5013 Final Project: VEGuality  

### By: Melissa Yeo, Brenda Khor, Dongxin Li

#### Design Executive Summary

* Strategy
    * <b>Problem</b>: We talked to vegans, and wanted to see what common problems they faced, and what could be done if they had a website. While a lot of them talked about lack of food options, another theme was that they felt alone, and that they had no support.
    * <b>User needs</b>: Community platform to ask questions, comment, and feel a part of something in relation to their vegan lifestyle. Also, vegan related resources in 1 location to expore and for them to be able to connect and share their stories and experiences. Many current websites currently tend to be more siloed e.g., information about restaurants and shops, articles related to vegan issues, events sites. Consequently, it is hard for a vegan person to access the information they want in a single site which is frustrating.
    * <b>Goal</b>: The fact that vegans donâ€™t feel supported and alone with their choice of lifestyle, we wanted to bridge the gap between loneliness and wanting to feel apart of a community. This website will help to not only serve as access of resources but also a forum to engage and interact with other people who identify as vegans, and can ask questions and comment on their own experiences. We want to build a space for them to interact with other people to gain insight or to even share their own experiences and expertise.    
    * <b>Target Audience</b>: Vegans and people who want to find out more about the movement
* Scope
    * Inline with the information surfaced through our interviews, we decided that the following would be our navbar tabs and related content
        * Switch - What's veganism, myths, tips, etc
        * Cook - Recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
        * Explore - what you can eat at restaurants if vegan, fashion, friendly cities, follow the movement events
        * Inspire - Video (inspire others to eat with care), how to talk to others, motivating texts
        * Connect - a way to interact with other people, post questions, and comment on other people's questions
            * Arranged by time stamp
        * Own feed - contain grocery list, my questions, and my story (and can delete)
